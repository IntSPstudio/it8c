# IT8c Library
I want certain features in python and I could not find similars so I made them.

Latest version: 0.0.2.20161103

Install: If you don't have "it8c" folder in python lib folder you can download "library" folder and move to python lib folder and change name to "it8c". If you do have "it8c" folder you can download and drag and drop new codes to that folder.

I have only tested this library on Windows
