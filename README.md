I wanted certain common features for my python softwares and there is no need to write the same lines for each different software. Check out the wiki to learn more.

Install: If you don't have "it8c" folder in python lib folder you can download "library" folder and move to python lib folder and change name to "it8c". If you do have "it8c" folder you can download and drag and drop new codes to that folder.
