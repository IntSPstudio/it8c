# IT8c Data Handling Library
I want certain features in python and I could not find similars so I made them. Check out the wiki.

Latest version: 0.0.8.20161228

Install: If you don't have "it8c" folder in python lib folder you can download "library" folder and move to python lib folder and change name to "it8c". If you do have "it8c" folder you can download and drag and drop new codes to that folder.

Tested with windows and linux
